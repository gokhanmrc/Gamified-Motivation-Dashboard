# 🚀 Personal Reward System: Gamified Performance Dashboard

A behavioral performance framework built with Excel/Google Sheets that turns daily productivity into a virtual economy. This project uses gamification principles, dynamic KPI tracking, and financial discipline to optimize personal motivation and habit consistency.

## 📈 Core Methodology
Unlike traditional budget trackers, this system treats rewards as "fuel" for future performance. It creates a sustainable loop between completing high-value tasks (SQL, Python, Data Projects) and earning "discretionary funds" for personal rewards.

## 🛠 Key Features & KPIs
- **Dynamic KPI Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of Net Motivation Balance, Discretionary Cap, and Performance Slippages.
- **Streak Multiplier:** A mathematical growth factor that rewards consecutive successful days to prevent habit churn.
- **Discipline Debit:** An automated penalty mechanism for missed routines, ensuring accountability.
- **Resource Allocation:** Strategically balancing "Virtual Earnings" from professional tasks with personal reward expenses.

## 🖥 Technical Implementation
- **Tools:** Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets
- **Techniques:** Complex logical formulas (`IF`, `AND`, `TODAY`), Conditional Formatting, Data Validation, and Dynamic Dashboard Design.
- **Structure:** Scalable data tables designed for 31-day performance cycles.
